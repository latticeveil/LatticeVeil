The **Artificer Update** is here! This major release (v6.0.0) consolidates all assets and features into a unified, high-performance voxel experience. 🚀

### 🪨 Nullblock (Bedrock)
The world's final layer is now canonically **Nullblock**. It is unbreakable in Survival mode and enforced at the very bottom of the world (Y=0). This provides a stable foundation for the layers of reality above.

### 📚 Full Lore Integration
Discover the secrets of the Ancient Architects! We've integrated full support for faction-based inscriptions and tablet fragments. You can now uncover the history of the Continuists, the Veilkeepers, and more through exploration.

### ⚒️ Artificer's Workbench
A new dedicated station has been added: the **Artificer's Workbench**. This is now the canonical station for advanced gatecraft and rule-driven creation.

### 🧱 New Blocks & Textures
We've added high-fidelity textures for several key lore blocks:
- **Runestone:** The building block of ancient structures.
- **Veinstone:** Resonant stone from the deep.
- **Veilglass:** Translucent barriers between realms.
- **Resonance Cores:** The heart of Waygate networks.

### 🔄 Engine Synchronization
To ensure a seamless update experience, we have aligned the versioning of both the game engine and the asset packs to **Version 6**. This major skip allows us to maintain a single, clear source of truth for all project files.
